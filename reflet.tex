Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing this letter of reference at the request of Muhammad Uliah Shafar, who is applying for the scholarship program.
I was Uliah's lecturer in the Architecture Department at University of Diponegoro.
As a part of M.Ars studies, Uliah was enrolled in my Urban Planning and Residential and Housing courses during the first year of his course.
My interaction with him became stronger when he started developing his master's degree thesis entitled: \textit{Visitor Preference on Public Space in Senggol Waterfront Parepare}, under my supervision.

Uliah was an outstanding student, exceptionally diligent and hardworking.
He was always attending, participating, and actively well engaging in the educational program.
He often raised a question or left a comment that triggers a whole class's discussion.
Not only that, he had successfully written a thesis that later gave him an overall graduate GPA of 4.0.
During the thesis activity, Uliah became very interested in Urban Space research.
His thesis under my supervision enriched his experience in data collection, data elaboration and statistical analysis.

Uliah has the motivation and interest on higher education.
He has been progressively working towards it with an extraordinary determination and sincerity.
If the accomplishment of his academic endeavor is a good indication of how he would be seen on his future education, he would be a positive asset to your scholarship program. %Therefore I highly recommend him for Uliah to receive your scholarship.
As a lecture who is willing to take a part of students' success, I fully encourage you to consider him for your scholarship program.


Yours sincerely,

Dear Admission Committee:

It is my pleasure to write in support of the application of \textbf{Muhammad Uliah Shafar} for his plan to pursue postgraduate program in your University.
I have worked alongside Uliah for the past 2 years, as a head of study program in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning at Muhammadiyah University Parepare.

I have been consistently impressed with Uliah's skill and understanding during the time he has been working as a lecture.
Uliah is well motivated, reliable and always gives full effort in his job.
He has been able to manage several subjects of study programs in our department.
Moreover, he has published an article in a reputable national journal and still continues.
In addition to his professional accomplishment, Uliah was quick to volunteer to assist other duty out of his area.

In these two years, even though our department is quite young and has just started to grow, Uliah has been well dedicated to our institution.
He has helped us on improving this department by promoting, building syllabus and lecturing students for this fresh Urban and Regional Planning study program.
His genuine work with other coworkers has made this program grows incredibly fast. Personally, I would describe his dedication as generous, service-oriented, and impressive.

I am extremely confident that Uliah would fit in your architecture program. As he has mentioned his dream to pursue higher education to me. To conclude, I am glad to give Muhammad Uliah Shafar my highest recommendation. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding his character or work.

\closing{Sincerely,}
